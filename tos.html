    <p><a href="http://www.adr.org/" target="_blank">Arbitration. Except for disputes relating to our intellectual property rights or claims that could be brought in small-claims court, all claims arising from or relating to this EULA or your use of the Mobile App shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;) in accordance with the provisions of its commercial arbitration rules and any supplementary procedures for consumer-related disputes, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions. The AAA rules are available at </a><a href="http://www.adr.org/" target="_blank">www.adr.org</a>. The arbitrator, and not any court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising from or relating to this Agreement, including without limitation any claim relating to its enforceability, performance, or breach. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court; provided, however, that the arbitrator will not have authority to award damages, remedies, or awards that conflict with this Agreement. The arbitrator's award shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. To the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the cost of filing a lawsuit, Brimstone&reg; will pay the additional cost. This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. The parties understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and that the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.</p>
